  abstract = {Spontaneous emission is not inherent to an emitter, but
	
	rather depends on its electromagnetic environment. In
	
	a microcavity, the spontaneous emission rate can be
	
	greatly enhanced compared with that in free space. This
	
	so-called Purcell effect can dramatically increase laser
	
	modulation speeds, although to date no time-domain
	
	measurements have demonstrated this. Here we show
	
	extremely fast photonic crystal nanocavity lasers with
	
	response times as short as a few picoseconds resulting
	
	from 75-fold spontaneous emission rate enhancement
	
	in the cavity. We demonstrate direct modulation speeds
	
	far exceeding 100 GHz (limited by the detector response
	
	time), already more than an order of magnitude above
	
	the fastest semiconductor lasers. Such ultrafast, efficient,
	
	and compact lasers show great promise for applications in
	
	high-speed communications, information processing, and
	
	on-chip optical interconnects.},

	Progress in developing high speed ADC’s occurs rather slowly - at
	a resolution increase of 1.8 bits per decade. This
	
	slow progress is mostly caused by the inherent jitter in electronic
	sampling - currently on the order of 250 femtoseconds
	
	in the most advanced CMOS circuitry. Advances in femtosecond lasers
	and laser stabilization have led to the
	
	development of sources of ultrafast optical pulse trains that show
	jitter on the level of a few femtoseconds over the time
	
	spans of typical sampling windows and can be made even smaller. The
	MIT-GHOST (GigaHertz High Resolution
	
	Optical Sampling Technology) Project funded under DARPA’s Electronic
	Photonic Integrated Circuit (EPIC) Program
	
	is trying to harness the low noise properties of femtosecond laser
	sources to overcome the electronic bottleneck
	
	inherently present in pure electronic sampling systems. Within this
	program researchers from MIT Lincoln Laboratory
	
	and MIT Campus develop integrated optical components and optically
	enhanced electronic sampling circuits that enable
	
	the fabrication of an electronic-photonic A/D converter chip that
	surpasses currently available technology in speed and
	
	resolution and opens up a technology development roadmap for ADC’s.
	This talk will give an overview on the planned
	
	activities within this program and the current status on some key
	devices such as wavelength-tunable filter banks, high-
	
	speed modulators, Ge photodetectors, miniature femtosecond-pulse lasers
	and advanced sampling techniques that are
	
	compatible with standard CMOS processing.},

	rithm to compute the definite-frequency eigenstates of Maxwell’s equa-
	
	tions in arbitrary periodic dielectric structures, including systems
	with
	
	anisotropy (birefringence) or magnetic materials, using preconditioned
	
	block-iterative eigensolvers in a planewave basis. Favorable scaling

	the system size and the number of computed bands is exhibited. We
	
	propose a new effective dielectric tensor for anisotropic structures,

	2demonstrate that O(∆x ) convergence can be achieved even in sys-
	
	tems with sharp material discontinuities. We show how it is possible
	to
	
	solve for interior eigenvalues, such as localized defect modes, without
	
	computing the many underlying eigenstates. Preconditioned conjugate-
	
	gradient Rayleigh-quotient minimization is compared with the David-

	preconditioners are characterized. Our implementation is freely avail-
