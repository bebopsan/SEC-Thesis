  abstract = {Spontaneous emission is not inherent to an emitter, but
	
	rather depends on its electromagnetic environment. In
	
	a microcavity, the spontaneous emission rate can be
	
	greatly enhanced compared with that in free space. This
	
	so-called Purcell effect can dramatically increase laser
	
	modulation speeds, although to date no time-domain
	
	measurements have demonstrated this. Here we show
	
	extremely fast photonic crystal nanocavity lasers with
	
	response times as short as a few picoseconds resulting
	
	from 75-fold spontaneous emission rate enhancement
	
	in the cavity. We demonstrate direct modulation speeds
	
	far exceeding 100 GHz (limited by the detector response
	
	time), already more than an order of magnitude above
	
	the fastest semiconductor lasers. Such ultrafast, efficient,
	
	and compact lasers show great promise for applications in
	
	high-speed communications, information processing, and
	
	on-chip optical interconnects.},

	Progress in developing high speed ADC’s occurs rather slowly - at
	a resolution increase of 1.8 bits per decade. This
	
	slow progress is mostly caused by the inherent jitter in electronic
	sampling - currently on the order of 250 femtoseconds
	
	in the most advanced CMOS circuitry. Advances in femtosecond lasers
	and laser stabilization have led to the
	
	development of sources of ultrafast optical pulse trains that show
	jitter on the level of a few femtoseconds over the time
	
	spans of typical sampling windows and can be made even smaller. The
	MIT-GHOST (GigaHertz High Resolution
	
	Optical Sampling Technology) Project funded under DARPA’s Electronic
	Photonic Integrated Circuit (EPIC) Program
	
	is trying to harness the low noise properties of femtosecond laser
	sources to overcome the electronic bottleneck
	
	inherently present in pure electronic sampling systems. Within this
	program researchers from MIT Lincoln Laboratory
	
	and MIT Campus develop integrated optical components and optically
	enhanced electronic sampling circuits that enable
	
	the fabrication of an electronic-photonic A/D converter chip that
	surpasses currently available technology in speed and
	
	resolution and opens up a technology development roadmap for ADC’s.
	This talk will give an overview on the planned
	
	activities within this program and the current status on some key
	devices such as wavelength-tunable filter banks, high-
	
	speed modulators, Ge photodetectors, miniature femtosecond-pulse lasers
	and advanced sampling techniques that are
	
	compatible with standard CMOS processing.},

  abstract = {The primary purpose of this book is to help scientists and engineers
	who
	
	work intensively with computers to become more productive, have more
	fun,
	
	and increase the reliability of their investigations. Scripting in
	the Python
	
	programming language can be a key tool for reaching these goals [28,30].
	
	The term scripting means different things to different people. By
	scripting
	
	I mean developing programs of an administering nature, mostly to organize
	
	your work, using languages where the abstraction level is higher and
	program-
	
	ming is more convenient than in Fortran, C, C++, or Java. Perl, Python,
	
	Ruby, Scheme, and Tcl are examples of languages supporting such high-level
	
	programming or scripting. To some extent Matlab and similar scientific
	com-
	
	puting environments also fall into this category, but these environments
	are
	
	mainly used for computing and visualization with built-in tools, while
	script-
	
	ing aims at gluing a range of different tools for computing, visualization,
	data
	
	analysis, file/directory management, user interfaces, and Internet
	communi-
	
	cation. So, although Matlab is perhaps the scripting language of choice
	in
	
	computational science today, my use of the term scripting goes beyond
	typi-
	
	cal Matlab scripts. Python stands out as the language of choice for
	scripting in
	
	computational science because of its very clean syntax, outstanding
	modular-
	
	ization features, good support for numerical computing, and rapidly
	growing
	
	popularity.},

	In this paper, we explore the concept of code readability
	
	and investigate its relation to software quality. With data
	
	collected from human annotators, we derive associations be-
	
	tween a simple set of local code features and human notions
	
	of readability. Using those features, we construct an au-
	
	tomated readability measure and show that it can be 80%
	
	eective, and better than a human on average, at predict-
	
	ing readability judgments. Furthermore, we show that this
	
	metric correlates strongly with two traditional measures of
	
	software quality, code changes and defect reports. Finally,
	
	we discuss the implications of this study on programming
	
	language design and engineering practice. For example, our
	
	data suggests that comments, in of themselves, are less im-
	
	portant than simple blank lines to local judgments of read-
