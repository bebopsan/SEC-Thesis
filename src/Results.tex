\chapter{Results}
\label{ch:Results}
As mentioned in the introduction, we developed a software platform able to simulate propagation of electromagnetic waves in Photonic Crystals. In chapter \ref{ch:Electromagnetic waves in periodic media} we stated the equations that rule the problem, and discussed background behind one method of solution using FEA in chapter \ref{ch:Finite_element_method}. In this chapter the solutions obtained by applying these concepts are presented and compared with either their analytic solutions or numerical solutions from the literature.

\section{Electrostatic benchmark tests}

\remove[SEC]{Now,} Platform \href{https://github.com/bebopsan/peyeQM}{PeyeQM } \url{https://github.com/bebopsan/peyeQM} \note[SEC]{Aquí había un hipervínculo al repositorio, pero no se ve al imprimir en blanco y negro} was built in a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design}{bottom-up } process that started by making a FE solver that could handle static scalar problems of electron confinement in 2D potential wells for application in Quantum Mechanics\footnote{At first, the PeyeQM was able to solve time independent Poisson and Schrödinger equations in 1D and 2D.}. This project involved an upgrade of that platform that began with the implementation of support for vector formulations, and a transition to Object Oriented Paradigm that could improve flexibility and maintenance.

The first section of this chapter shows the results obtained for Electrostatic benchmark tests, and were made in order to assert the accuracy of the static vectorial solver, and  routines for the construction of stiffness matrices.

\subsection{Electric field due to charged elements}
\subsubsection{Parallel plate capacitor}
The first experiment was to simulate the most basic field we could think of, this is, that inside a parallel plate capacitor, where field lines go straight from one plate to the other. 

Electric fields satisfy equation \ref{eq:diff_Faraday}. If there are no sources or sinks ($- \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}=0)$, then the field $\mathbf{E}$ is said to be \textit{irrotational} and by an \href{http://ebooksgo.org/mathematics/Vector_Identity.pdf}{identity of vector} calculus we know that there must exist a scalar field $V$ whose gradient is a valid electrostatic vector field:
\begin{equation}
\nabla\times\nabla V = 0.
\label{eq:Laplace}
\end{equation}
Scalar equations are easier to solve and are very useful when the medium is homogeneous and isotropic, this is the reason why many books stick with scalar problems and leave the process of obtaining $\mathbf{E}$ as performing on $V$ the derivations in operator $\nabla$. Using the scalar potential as an intermediate step for the solution of $\mathbf{E}$ stops being a good idea when interfaces between mediums and sharp geometries appear, and a direct solution using vector fields gains relevance.

In a parallel plate capacitor like that in figure \ref{fig:parallel_plate}, we consider two (infinite, parallel, plane, perfectly conducting, charged) plates that occupy the planes $x = 0$ and $x = d$ kept at potentials $V = 0$ and $V = V_0$ respectively.  
With plates of very large dimensions compared to the spacing between them, the potential becomes a function of $x$ only, and equation \ref{eq:Laplace} becomes:
$$\dfrac{d^2V}{d x^2}=0.$$ Integrating twice, we get: 
\begin{equation}
V(x) = Ax + B.
\end{equation}
Where $A$  and $B$ are constants of integration solved by using the following boundary conditions\remove[SEC]{.}
\begin{align*}
V(0) &= A0 + B = 0 \quad or \quad B = 0,\\
V(d) &= Ad + B = V_0 \quad or \quad A = \dfrac{V_0}{d}.
\end{align*}

Making the particular solution for the potential:
$$V=\dfrac{V_0}{d}x \quad for \quad 0<x<d.$$ 
The field is then obtained by taking the gradient of $V$, and we add a $-$ sign taking into account that $\mathbf{E}$ is a conservative field

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E}= -\nabla V = - \dfrac{dV}{dx}\hat{a}_x = -\dfrac{V}{d}\hat{a}_x.
\end{equation}
This means that the field is uniform and directed from the higher potential plate to the lower potential plate as shown in figure  \ref{fig:parallel_plate} and reference \cite{Rao2004}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{./img/parallel_plate_capacitor.pdf}
\caption{Cross sectional view of parallel plate capacitor.}
\label{fig:parallel_plate}
\end{figure}

A rectangular region \add{filled with a perfect dielectric and with perfect conductor upper and lower plates} was meshed and Dirichlet boundary condition were applied.  Separation $d$ is taken unitary and the result is shown in figure \ref{fig:capacitor}. \add[SEC]{We imposed the constant value of 12 V /m on the boundary.}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{./img/capacitor.pdf}
\caption{Solution of electric field in parallel plate capacitor.\add[SEC]{Boundary conditions on vertical sides were such that edge effects are avoided.}}
\label{fig:capacitor}
\end{figure}

It can be seen that the lines \change[SEC]{don't}{do not} change in either magnitude or direction, and go from the charged plate \change{wit}{with} potential $V_0$ to the bottom plate as expected.

This test showed that the routines for assembling stiffness matrices are capable of continuing a simple field over a distance between to boundaries. \add[SEC]{If a representation of a finite capacitor is intended one must create a larger domain (or one with infinite boundaries) in which the plates are embedded.} 

The script for producing this simulation and the necessary input files can be seen in the 
\href{https://github.com/bebopsan/peyeQM/tree/Depuration/Lib/OOPyQM/Examples/Capacitor}{\textit{repository}} at \url{https://github.com/bebopsan/peyeQM/tree/Depuration/Lib/OOPyQM/Examples/Capacitor} \note[SEC]{De nuevo, esto estaba como un hipervínculo en la versión digital del documento.}

\subsubsection{Charged cylinder}

The next field problem to solve in order to test PeyeQM was one with circular geometry. The solution for the field due to a \remove[SEC]{point charge or a} charged cylinder was used to compare the precision of the method for representing fields with two components.

Gauss law \ref{eq:Gauss} in spherical coordinates, assuming a homogeneous medium with scalar permittivity is:

\begin{equation}
\epsilon \int_S \mathbf{E}\cdot d\mathbf{S} = \int_V \rho dV.
\end{equation}

Where $\int_V \rho dV = q$ is the total charge of the \change[SEC]{particle}{cylinder}. If that charge is distributed uniformly, then there are no preferred directions and the electric field must be radial \cite{Cheng1993}, and have constant intensity over spherical shells. So for an arbitrary spherical shell of radius $r$ \add[SEC]{the field outside is given by:}

\begin{align*}
&\epsilon \mathbf{E} \int_{\theta}\int_{\phi} r^2 sin(\theta) d \phi = q, \\
& \mathbf{E}_r(r) = \frac{q}{4\pi \epsilon r^2} \hat{r}.
\end{align*}
This has to be transformed into cartesian coordinates in order to input boundary conditions. If we consider $r$ as the magnitude of vector $\vec{r}$ in the unitary direction $\hat{r}$ then we can transform it to a linear combination of unitary vectors $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$ by the following:
\begin{equation}
\vec{r} = r cos(\theta) \hat{x} + r sin(\theta) \hat{y},
\end{equation}
\change[SEC]{A}{a}nd by trigonometry we know that $cos(\theta) =\dfrac{x}{r}$ and $sin(\theta)=\dfrac{y}{r}$. Making the necessary substitutions we get to:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{E}_r(r) = \mathbf{E}_x(x,y) + \mathbf{E}_y(x,y) = \frac{qx}{4\pi \epsilon \sqrt{\left(x^2+y^2\right)}^3} \hat{x}+\frac{qy}{4\pi \epsilon \sqrt{\left(x^2+y^2\right)}^3} \hat{y}.
\end{equation}
So, a plot \add[SEC]{of} the solution after simulating should match a representation of this analytic result. We initially proposed a model where the charged cylinder or point source is modeled as a \href{https://github.com/bebopsan/peyeQM/tree/
Depuration/Lib/OOPyQM/Examples/Whole\%20cylinder}{whole charged circle inside a square domain}, the results of the simulation ( figure \ref{fig:whole_cylinder}) showed that for this kind of problem where the field decays in the form $\dfrac{1}{r^2}$ it was better to use finer meshes and take advantage of symmetries to reduce the computational cost. \add[SEC]{This simulation was performed assuming perfect dielectric materials and assuming a coefficient $\frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon}$ such that the field normal to the edge is equal to 12 V/m.}
Taking just an eight of the model, and reshaping the outer boundary to a circle improved the quality of the elements and allowed us to use a finer mesh. figure \ref{fig:eight_of_cylinder} shows the $y$ and $x$ components of the field as well as the error between the simulation and the analytic solution.
For the simulation \remove[SEC]{factor $\dfrac{q}{2\pi \epsilon}$ has been normalized to 1, and }the mesh was made of 1996 QUAD8 elements with 5525 nodes, thus 11050 degrees of freedom. As a comparison, the simulation of the whole circle involved 2432 elements and 7040 nodes with 14080 degrees of freedom, but it solved for a domain that was eight times bigger.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Electric \change{D}{d}ipole, two charged spheres.}

A similar simulation was performed using two semicircular surfaces, taking advantage of inversion symmetry along $x$ axis. Boundary conditions are Dirichlet conditions over the circles and the rectangular boundaries on top, and Neumann conditions set to 0 on bottom lines.  The analytic solution is simply the overlapping of the field due to charge 1 and charge 2, having one of them centered in the origin, and the other displaced by a distance $d$. The field everywhere can be expressed as: 

\begin{align}
&\mathbf{E}_1(x,y)=x\left(x^2+y^2\right)^{-\frac{3}{2}}\hat{x} + y\left(x^2+y^2\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}\hat{y},\\ 
&\mathbf{E}_2(x,y)=-(x-4)\left((x-4)^2+y^2\right)^{-\frac{3}{2}} \hat{x}-y\left((x-4)^2+y^2\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}\hat{y},\\
&\mathbf{E}_x = \left[ x\left(x^2+y^2\right)^{-\frac{3}{2}} -(x-4)\left((x-4)^2+y^2\right)^{-\frac{3}{2}}\right] \hat{x},\\
&\mathbf{E}_y =\left[ y\left(x^2+y^2\right)^{\frac{3}{2}} -y\left((x-4)^2+y^2\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}\right]\hat{y}.
\end{align}

Where again $\dfrac{q}{4\pi \epsilon}$ \change[SEC]{for the left charged circle and $-1$ for the one on the right at a distance $d=4$}{is such that the field normal to the cylinders is scaled to a value of 12 V/m at radius $d=4$}. Figure \ref{fig:two_cylinders} shows components $x$ and $y$ of the resulting field as obtained from the FE solver. The direction of the field lines can be observed by means of arrow glyphs in figure \ref{fig:two_cylinders_glyph}, where field lines go outwards in the positively charged cylinder and inwards in the negative.
In the same way as before, a comparison between analytic and numerical solutions was performed (figure \ref{fig:two_cylinders_error}) and error appeared to be magnified in the region between cylinders. This value keeps being higher than expected, and different meshing schemes were tested in order to improve accuracy. Less error was observed using adaptative meshing methods than structured grids. The current mesh for this simulation has 510 elements and 1622 degrees of freedom, a future simulation is proposed with finer meshes using a PC with bigger RAM.

\section{Harmonic benchmark tests}
The second section regards solutions of eigenvalue problems, either for closed domains or infinite and periodic ones. The first part will deal with simulation of resonant modes in waveguides, and the second with free waves and periodic crystals. \add[SEC]{All simulations assume perfect dielectric materials inside the waveguide and perfect conductor boundaries, this means that no losses are to be considered.}  
In this stage of Pe\change[SEC]{Y}{y}eQM we knew that the program was capable of assembling stiffness matrices and solving systems of linear equations\change[SEC]{,}{.} \change[SEC]{w}{W}hat the following tests with resonant cavities give is the certainty that we \change[SEC]{were}{are} able to form useful mass matrices, as well as solve the eigenvalue problems associated with a formulation of the form:
\[\mathbb{A}\mathbf{\vec{E}} = \mathbb{M}\mathbf{\vec{E}}.\]
\note[SEC]{Lo que las pruebas con cavidades resonantes nos dan es la seguridad de que somos capaces de formar matrices de masa útiles, así como solucionar problemas de autovalores asociados a la formulación de la forma:}

\subsection{Eigenvalues and modes in wave-guides}

Ideal wave\remove[SEC]{-}guides can be modeled by a source-less version of the wave equation for time harmonic fields \ref{eq:E-wave-harmonic} in arbitrary 2D domains closed by a metallic \add[SEC]{(perfect conductor)} boundary that guarantees Dirichlet condition $\mathbf{E} = 0\quad at\quad \Gamma$ . This problem is relevant in electromagnetism and telecommunications because it is the principle behind many applications such as data transmission in fiber optics, and \change[SEC]{microwaves}{signal guiding of microwave radiation}. Here, the 2D domain represents a cross section of a metallic structure that guides waves along its axis. We are particularly interested in knowing two things:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The modes or wave functions that are solution to the equation for a particular shape.
\item The frequencies associated to those modes or shapes. 
\end{enumerate}
And will start by introducing the analytic solution behind simple wave\remove[SEC]{-}guides such as rectangular and circular guides.

\subsubsection{Rectangular waveguides} 

In transverse magnetic fields (TM) that travel inside a wave-guide whose axis is over $z$, we have $\mathbf{H}_z = 0$ and solve for $\mathbf{E}$ components. 
Solutions of equation \ref{eq:E-wave-harmonic2}, where the medium inside the wave guide is a perfect dielectric, and  for eigenvalues $k^2 = \omega^2\mu\epsilon$ is a lengthy but straightforward process that involves separation of variables and use of boundary conditions:
\begin{align}
&\mathbf{E}_x = 0 \quad for \quad y=0,\ 0<x<a\\
&\mathbf{E}_x = 0 \quad for \quad y=b,\ 0<x<a\\
&\mathbf{E}_y = 0 \quad for \quad x=0,\ 0<y<b\\
&\mathbf{E}_y = 0 \quad for \quad x=a,\ 0<y<b
\label{eq:square_bc}
\end{align}

A description of the solution process is left for the reader to look up in references such as Rao  \cite{Rao2004} or Jianming \cite{Jin2010}. What is found in the process is that only certain discrete frequencies are allowed inside the wave\remove[SEC]{-}guide, and they are given by:

\begin{equation}
\omega_{n,m} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu\epsilon}}\sqrt{\left(\frac{m\pi}{a}\right)^2+\left(\frac{n\pi}{b}\right)^2}
\qquad m,n = 0,1,2,\cdots \quad (m=n\neq0).
\label{eq:eig_vals_sqare_waveguide}
\end{equation}
Where $\omega$ is indexed by integers $n,m$ and the trivial solution $\omega = 0$ is excluded. $a$ is the width of the rectangular cross section and $b$ is its height.
The wave functions that are solution to this eigenproblem for each component of the field are in the following general form:

\begin{align}
&\mathbf{E}_z = A\sin{\dfrac{m\pi x}{a}}\sin{\dfrac{n\pi x}{b}}e^{\mp jk_zz}, \label{eq:Ez_mag}\\
&\mathbf{E}_x =\mp jB\dfrac{m\pi}{a}\cos{\dfrac{m\pi x}{a}}\sin{\dfrac{n\pi x}{b}}e^{\mp jk_zz},\\
&\mathbf{E}_y =\mp jC\dfrac{n\pi}{b}\sin{\dfrac{m\pi x}{a}}\cos{\dfrac{n\pi x}{b}}e^{\mp jk_zz}.
\end{align}

For our comparisons we will only look at how closely the shapes of the simulated solution represent $\mathbf{E}$ in \add[SEC]{equation} \ref{eq:Ez_mag}, and how similar are the analytic and numeric  natural frequencies of the guide $\omega$. \add[SEC]{In order to obtain values to compare guides of arbitrary size we normalize the frequency by using a normalization factor $\frac{a}{2\pi}$.} Table \ref{tab:sq_wav_comparison} \add[SEC]{shows the difference between the non-dimensional normalized frequency simulated with PeyeQM and calculated by hand.} Table \ref{fig:rectangular_waveguide} \add[SEC]{shows non-dimensional eigenvalues for rectangular waveguides where one side is twice the other.}

The numerical solution for a rectangular waveguide is shown in figure \ref{fig:rectangular_waveguide}, it has less degenerate TM modes, and the shapes are in better accordance with typical representations. Only the x component of the field is shown because there were not significant differences between the shapes.

\subsubsection{Circular waveguides}

A circular wave-guide was also modeled in order to test the platform for the solution of problems with curved shapes and non-regular meshes. The modes are presented in figure \ref{fig:circular_waveguide}, and their shapes are in close accordance with the expected form of Bessel functions as illustrated in reference \cite{Soto2009}. The mathematical expression for the analytic solution of eigenvalues is related to the roots of Bessel J functions for indexes $m$ and $n$ similar to those in the rectangular case. More details of the expression are left for the reader to look up in references such as Rao \cite{Rao2004}. 
Again, the results for eigenvalues are presented in table \ref{tab:cir_wav_comparison} as non-dimensional numbers using the normalization factor $\frac{a}{c}$ which lacks the term $2\pi$ due to the shape of the problem.

\subsubsection{Elliptical waveguide}

Elliptical waveguides are an example of other problems that are complex to solve analytically, and easy for FEM codes. In contrast with hexagonal waveguides, elliptical waveguides can be separated in a given coordinate system, in this case \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_coordinate_system}{the elliptic coordinate system.} Solutions for resonance in elliptical domains are given by \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathieu_function}{Mathieu functions} and are described in a study by J. Guti\'errez Vega \cite{J.Gutierrez-Vega1999}. Shapes of electric field magnitude of TM modes are shown in figure \ref{fig:elliptical_waveguide} and are in agreement with the images in the reference. Additionally, the non-dimensional eigenvalues are presented in table

\subsubsection{Isoespectral shapes}
We also tested the solver by performing the computation of isoespectral shapes as proposed by Chapman in \cite{Chapman1995}. The idea behind this was to obtain the same eigenvalues from different shapes by taking advantage of possible mappings between figures that share certain properties.
A comparison between eigenvalues is presented in table \ref{tab:iso_wav_comparison}, and the first 4 non-degenerate modes are shown in figure \ref{fig:isoespectral_waveguide}.

\subsubsection{Finite lattices}

Now that the software was tested for the solution of eigenvalue problems, it needed to prove its ability to handle simulations of fields inside heterogeneous domains, \change[SEC]{like}{as} in Photonic Crystals. As mentioned in the implementation chapter, this is performed by defining regions with contrasting permitivity values. The construction and proof of performance in the context of finite lattices is a very important step towards modeling of transitory phenomena and future implementation of defects. 
The results presented in this section are from tests where the harmonic wave equation is solved for a finite, 2D Bravais lattice very similar to the one shown in figure \ref{fig:sq_lat_fig} where the primitive vectors are orthogonal and of equal magnitude $a_1$ = $a_2$. In this lattice the pattern that is repeated by the vectors is a square shaped unit cell that has embedded a circular inhomogeneity. 
Due to computational resources the grid is made by $4\times 4$ unit cells where the ratio $\dfrac{r}{a}=0.2$ is given between the radius of the circular inclusion and the characteristic length of the cell. The material of the inclusion has a dielectric constant $\epsilon_r = 8.9$ and the surrounding media is assumed to be air $\epsilon =1$. Boundary conditions are as presented in \add[SEC]{equation} \ref{eq:square_bc}, this is, inside a rectangular metallic boundary like if in a wave\remove[SEC]{-}guide. The expected result is to see concentration of field inside regions with higher $\epsilon$\change[SEC]{. A}{, a}s well as slightly bigger non-dimensional eigenvalues than those produced by homogeneous medium. this is due to light speed $c$ being in the denominator of $\frac{\omega
a}{2\pi c}$. 

\add[SEC]{We also noted that the first TM modes of both cases are very similar and with higher modes the confinement in dielectric rods is easier to visualize. This can be explained by remembering that for bigger wavelengths the material looks homogeneous to the wave. As the frequency increases the wavelength is reduced to a size comparable to that of the inclusions, and they start acting as resonant cavities as well.}

\caption{Non-dimensional eigenvalues $\frac{\omega a}{2\pi c}$ for TM modes in  square shaped waveguides with and without inclusion of higher electric permitivity regions. The side of the guide $a$ is taken as the characteristic length, $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum and the rods have a relative electrical permitivity of 8.9. As expected, we have bigger eigenvalues for the region with higher dielectric constant $\epsilon$.}
\label{tab:fin_lat_comparison}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Note in table \ref{tab:fin_lat_comparison} that if frequencies found for the air filled case are multiplied by two (this domain is twice as big) and then squared, we get the same result as in \add[SEC]{table}  \ref{tab:sq_wav_comparison}. 
Figure \ref{fig:fin_lat_waveguide} illustrates the difference between solving for an homogeneous and non-homogenous problems. The flexibility to easily model interfaces and to couple regions is one of the great advantages of using both the Finite Element Method and a vectorial formulation. Notice that these are solutions that are hard to solve analytically.

This figure shows what happens with a) the magnitude of the field and b) the x component, when dielectric rods are included. Each block compares the result with the modes shown in figure \ref{fig:square_waveguide} the first row of the block being in a waveguide without rods and the second with the lattice. This simulation allowed us to confirm that the software was capable of handling situations with multiple regions and with contrasts in material properties.}

\subsection{Bloch periodic lattices and dispersion curves}
Finally, we solved the harmonic equation for infinite crystals by defining Bloch periodicity boundary conditions over a unitary cell. \add[SEC]{This was accomplished by means of routines that interpreted opposing sides of the unitary cells as points that necessarily satisfy equation} \ref{eq:bloch_condition}. \add[SEC]{ If seen in the context of Bravais lattices, what we do here is to discretize only the unit cell shown in figure} \ref{fig:sq_lat_fig}  \add[SEC]{and construct the infinite lattice by multiplying with phase factors that are dependent on all possible reciprocal vectors G defined in expression} \ref{reciprocal_vectors}.
Looping through combinations of phase changes at boundaries, allowed us to see the spectrum for the crystal given different incident plane waves defined by varying wave number $\vec{k}$. 
Dispersion plots shown in figures \ref{fig:dispersion_plot_ra01}, \ref{fig:dispersion_plot_ra02}, and \ref{fig:dispersion_plot_ra04} are made by taking only the perimeter of the irreducible Brillouin zone which is the minimal representation of the domain in frequency space.\add[SEC]{This zone is illustrated in figure} \ref{fig:Brillouin},  \add[SEC]{it is defined as a zone that has been reduced by using all of the symmetries in the point group of the lattice. For details about Brillouin zones and symmetry groups, the reader is referred to Kittels famous books on solid state phisics }\cite{Kittel2005}. 

Figure \ref{fig:frequency_surfaces} shows the complete representation of natural frequencies for the lattice given every combination of incident plane waves with wave number $\vec{k} = \vec{k}_x+\vec{k}_y$ inside a unitary cell.
The results presented in figure \ref{fig:dispersion_plot_ra02} were made with the same conditions as those used by Joannopolous in page 68 of the book: \textbf{Photonic Crystals: molding the flow of light} \cite{Joannopoulos2008} and agree with their findings. Apart from great similarity between the curves, our value of $31.41\%$ for the gap-midgap ratio is close to the one reported by them of $31.4\%$.
