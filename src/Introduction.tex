\chapter{Introduction}

Preface:

Definition of the problem will be treated in chapter \ref{ch:Problem}, followed by a brief state of the art recollection where some background in the topics of photonic crystals and computational methods for physics will be mentioned. Then, fundamental concepts behind light propagation in periodic materials (chapter \ref{ch:Electromagnetic waves in periodic media})  and the model used for the finite element procedure used are presented.
