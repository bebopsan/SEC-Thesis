\section{Conclusions}
The objectives were met.

\section{Future work}
\begin{itemize}
\item Define vectorial triangular elements and scalar quadrilateral elements.
\item Consider adding regions with Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) for the simulation of
	  open domains.
\item Evaluate convergence of the method for the problems described in chapter \ref{ch:Results} using finer spatial and spectral meshes. 
\item Perform more simulations of time dependent problems involving deffects in finite crystals. And compare the results of Q factor and efficiency with other publications.
\item Integrate the CAD and solver into a optimization algorithm that maximizes transmission or confinement by inducing variations in position and shape of defects in the lattice.
\item Consider parallelization schemes to be implemented in order to make bigger simulations plausible.
\end{itemize}
