\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my family for their support and inspiration, specially my mom, who planted in me the seed of scientific curiosity, my big sister who I admire, and my dad who has been of great company and support for these years.

I also owe my gratitude to my friend and advisor Nicol\'as Guar\'in Zapata who accompanied me through the making this project. His endless patience, time and knowledge were invaluable resources.

To all the professors of the Engineering Physics Program for my academic and personal formation, and particularly to professors Mario Elkin V\'elez and Juan Manuel Jaramillo, who fed my curiosity with interesting conversations and research opportunities.
